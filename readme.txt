Allows you to redirect to page, post or any other custom post type.

== Description ==

With this plugin you can include nice short links to your posts, pages or other custom post types etc that you can include in videos or other articles.
Example: site.com/goto/123 where 123 is the ID of the post, page.

You can construct the short links using other ways.
* site.com/link/123
* site.com/page/123
* site.com/post/123

We specifically didn't add 'go' because lots of people are using it for affiliate links already.
